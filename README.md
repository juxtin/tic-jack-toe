# Tic-Jack-Toe
A two-player, turn-based game in which the goal is to place three marks ("X" for one player, "O" for the other) in a row --- either vertically, horizontally, or along one of the boards 2 diagonals.

This application is written in the Jack language, an elementary object-oriented language modeled on Java.

## Overview
This project was written to satisfy chapter 9 of the [Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org) course. It's not so much meant to be fun or exciting as it is to be a test of the platform and the compiler. You can run it using the VM emulator from the Nand2Tetris site.
